     * Create a ZooKeeper group/directory (i.e., a persistent ZNode) with the given name.
     *
     * One can think of ZooKeeper as a bunch of directories (so, think of a file tree). Clients create these
     * things called ZNodes, which can be thought of as directories with extra functionality. There are a few
     * different kinds of ZNodes we can create.
     *
     * Persistent ZNodes do not get deleted after the client who created them disconnects. So, if Client1 creates
     * a persistent ZNode "/foo" and then disconnects, the "/foo" ZNode will still exist in ZooKeeper. This is useful
     * for creating the group itself.
     *
     * Clients can then join this group by creating a so-called "ephemeral" ZNode. Ephemeral ZNodes are deleted after
     * the client who created them disconnects.
     *
     * So let's say we want to have a group called "TheGroup". We can create a persistent ZNode "/TheGroup". Then,
     * clients can join the group by creating ephemeral, child ZNodes of "/TheGroup". For example, Client1 could create
     * an ephemeral ZNode "/TheGroup/Client1". As long as the "/TheGroup/Client1" ZNode exists, everybody in the group
     * knows that Client1 is active. Maybe Client2 will add its own ephemeral ZNode "/TheGroup/Client2", so now there
     * are two ephemeral ZNodes ("/TheGroup/Client1" and "/TheGroup/Client2") and one persistent ZNode ("/TheGroup").
     *
     * So, this method creates a PERSISTENT ZNode.
     *
     * NOTE: This also creates the persistent ZNodes for the permanent and guest sub-groups.
