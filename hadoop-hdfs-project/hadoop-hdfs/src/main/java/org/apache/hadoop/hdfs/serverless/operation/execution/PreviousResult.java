 * Used to wrap a previously-computed result by the worker thread.

 * discarding them. The results are held onto in case the client does not receive the result. Clients may
 * re-submit the FS operation in this scenario, in which case the worker thread will check if it still has
 * the result in-memory. If it does, it will return it. If it doesn't, then it will return nothing, and the
 * client must simply restart the operation from scratch.
 *
 * For now, the worker thread would not re-perform the given operation was FS operations are obviously not
 * ephemeral and redoing the same operation more than once could have undesirable side effects in some cases.
 *
 * Note: this class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals.
